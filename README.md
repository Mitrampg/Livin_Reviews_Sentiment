# Livin_Reviews_Sentiment

This project concentrates on analyzing and predicting user reviews in specific case studies. 
Using text processing and deep learning methods, this project aims to understand the sentiment of user reviews and predict their classification.

## Deployment

Here is the deployed model application link where you can write your review and test whether the model classifies it as a good or bad review: https://bit.ly/livin_reviews_pred

## Dataset

This dataset is an origin app review of Livin Mandiri App in Playstore, which is originally in Indonesian language.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can analyze the text of user reviews, process them and predict the sentiment contained in them. 
This model aims to provide useful insights in understanding user feedback.

## Workflow
Workflow processes include:

Installation and import of required libraries.

Loads and reviews data, providing an overview.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before and after text processing.

Apply various text processing techniques such as contraction expansion, normalization, punctuation removal, stopwords removal, and lemmatization.

Defining and training an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model with several variations and tuning.

Evaluate the model to assess its effectiveness in predicting review sentiment.

Save the trained model for inference on new data.

## Conclusion

The project succeeded in developing an LSTM model that is effective in analyzing and predicting review sentiment. 
The model shows satisfactory results, but still has room for improvement, especially in terms of text processing and model tuning. 
These results open opportunities for further developments in sentiment analysis and understanding user reviews.
